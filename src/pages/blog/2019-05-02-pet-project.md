  Starting out on a little pet project of mine, yayers!! Decided to do a little
  MVC JQM project and to learn as I develop it further.

So I have a QNAP at home which I use as a media server connected to my Google TV. The idea is to have an app on my mobile that I can use to browse and search for movies from my collection in the NAS and eventually push them to Google TV (DLNA, UPNP, AirPlay??) so that they start playing.

I use a freeware movie cataloging software that can actually scan the NAS filesystem and fetch related information such as actors. IMDB ratings etc from the Internet and save it in an MS Access database. I have already exported that .mdb file to a SQL Express database to get started, so all the relevant fields I want to search on, are there.

The next step would be to create an MVC 4 with JQM project and get the ball rolling.
