title: About me
---

I’m passionate about technology. I’m all about integration and automation. I run multiple systems across my house that talk to each other, do simple to complex tasks and even make decisions.

And this is what I offer to companies. My passion for delivering digital efficiency and integration in increasing technological, ambiguous and constantly evolving environments. And my ability to ensure successful strategic initiatives and tech transition, that is future-proof and people-centric to give organisations the competitive edge.

It’s this approach that has resulted in my career-trajectory, appointed to deliver on things that others said could never be delivered. Or implementing integration across technological platforms that others said couldn’t be done.

> My motto is - it CAN be done. And whatever we do should always improve the quality of life for the user, and ensure the efficiency, productivity and effortlessness for the organisation.

For over a decade, I’ve spear-headed digital transformation for government and private organisations, helping to diversify technological offerings and improve useability, and performance for business growth and multi-million dollar bottom-line reduction.

With a clear results-focus and a commercial and strategic mind-set, I provide digital and web direction across multi-disciplinary, international teams to execute on corporate strategy, supported by digital and tech transformation.

> Nothing beats the satisfaction of taking a complex problem and finding a solution that brings peace to the factions e.g. business and operations.
